# Code conventions

## Introduction
This file will be used to store the coding conventions we will use for the duration of this project.
(subject to change)


## Code conventions
For this project, we can follow the W3Schoools standard coding conventions
https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_conventions.asp
This will be implemented using the standard ECMAScript linter (eslinter)

1) Use camelcase (JavaScript convention)

2) Use uppercase for constants

3) use callback as the name for callback function arguments

4) Where possible, avoid global variables

5) Access objects using '.' syntax, rather than [] syntax

6) Explicitly declare all variables you intend to use.

7) When indenting blocks, use 4 spaces

functions
The arguments for a callback will be labelled as "callback"

Where possible, use ES6 syntax??


use ===, rather than ==.
=== does implicit typecasting, which is would be best to avoid.

Constructors begin with uppercase letters.
