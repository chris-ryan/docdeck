### What is Node.JS?

Node is basically a wrapper around the V8 JavaScript runtime (the same one that chrome uses to run JS ) to allow it to run JS as 'apps' on a server.

#### Blocking vs non-blocking code


The general principle of Node is that operations should never block. 
This is at the heart of what delivers the high concurrency and effciency.

### Installing Node.js
#### MacOS and Windows
Go to https://nodejs.org/en/ and download and install the "current" installer package.


### Hello World
Create a new file (hello.js) and open it with your favourite editor

```
var http = require('http');

http.createServer(function(request, response) {
    response.writeHead(200); //outputs the status code in the header
    response.write("Hello world, this is Node.JS"); // the body of the response
    response.end(); //close the connection

}).listen(8080);
```

* From your terminal/command line run the server using:
```node hello.js```
* In another terminal/command line window, hit the server to view the response:
```curl http://localhost:8080```
* ctrl + c to stop the node server process.

## Events

Look at the earlier Hello World code.

When its executed, Node goes through the code and registers any known events. 
In this case it registers  *request*.

>> Pop over to the node docs page for the [http module](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v6.x/docs/api/http.html) and see the objects within the http.ClientRequest class it considers to be events.

Node then goes into an event loop. Where its continuously checking for the registered events.

In our code, that means node is listening for a 'request' to come in.
When the request is received, node then runs the code in the callback (reponse)'

Let's modify our earlier hello.js, adding a line to log the incoming request by referring to the request.url property.

```
var http = require('http');

http.createServer(function(request, response) {
    response.writeHead(200);
    console.log("Incoming request:" + request.url);
    response.write("Hello world, this is Node.JS");
    response.end();

}).listen(8080);
```
Fire up the node hello.js, go to localhost:8080 in your browser and take a look in your terminal to see the console output.

You'll notice two requests, one for "/" and another for "/favicon.ico". Don't stress about that last one. Whenever you load a url modern browsers look for a corresponding favicon to put a pretty icon in their tabs.

Now try putting in something after "localhost:8080/" in your browser's url bar: Eg: http://localhost:8080/bobsyouruncle

You'll see "Incoming request:/bobsyouruncle" now gets logged to the console. 

This is at the core of how we can use the url property to differentiate incoming requests and serve up different pages in response.
