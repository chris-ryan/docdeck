# Code conventions

## Introduction
This file will be used to store the coding conventions we will use for the duration of this project.
(subject to change)


## Code conventions
For this project, we can follow the W3Schoools standard coding conventions
https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_conventions.asp
This will be implemented using the standard ECMAScript linter (eslinter)

1) Use the eslinter

2) Use camelcase (JavaScript convention). Eg: newFunction.

2) Use uppercase for global constants

5) Where possible, avoid global variables

5) Access objects using '.' syntax, rather than [] syntax

6) Explicitly declare all variables you intend to use

7) When indenting blocks, use 4 spaces

## functions
The arguments for a callback will be labelled as "callback"

When possible, try to use async-await, rather than returning a newly created Promise
